# Introduction
As I finished my studies in Paris some months ago and started working, I thought it would be time to move to a more appropriate apartment. The problem, however, is that we are talking about a rather large city, even if limiting the search in its central *Arrondissements*, therefore it is important to have an understanding of the most suitable alternatives before investing in something as important as a home. 

# The Business problem
Data science will come to my help! My idea for this project is to determine which are the closest neighborhoods to my workplace and, establish which are my priorities in terms of venues in the surroundings (parks, basketball courts, supermarkets etc.). The main question I will be trying to answer is: which is the best neighborhood where to look for a new apartment, prioritising 1) distance from workplace and 2) the amenities nearby?
The result should be a list of possible administrative neighborhoods that satisfy the criterie i.e. proximity to target location (e.g. current workplace) and necessary amenities defined by the user.

## The target public
This study would be of course be profitable to many people, as a problem that I always find when moving to new places has been that you are not fully unaware of *where* you are looking for, focusing mostly on pricing (which of course is essential), but sometimes forgetting that there are many other key things to take into account to live a more comfortable life.
Therefore, the user will be provided with a list of potential locations where he could look for housing, taking into account her money constraints.
